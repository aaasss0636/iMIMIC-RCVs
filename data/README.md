The models were trained on:
* Camelyon 16
* Camelyon 17

Concept measures were extracted from the nuclei segmentation data set:
* A dataset and a technique for generalized nuclear segmentation for computational pathology. Kumar et al.

The dataset contains WSIs of several organs with more than 21,000 annotated nuclei boundaries. From this data set,
we extracted 300 training patches only from the WSIs of breast tissue.
